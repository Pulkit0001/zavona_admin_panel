                            <p>In line with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, and global best practices (as followed by Uber and Zomato):</p>

                            <h3>Purpose Limitation:</h3>
                            <p>We retain data only as long as it serves the original purpose of collection (e.g., completing bookings, resolving disputes, or complying with statutory record- keeping).</p>
                            <h3>Legal &amp; Regulatory Compliance:</h3>
                            <p>Certain records (such as payment or KYC data) must be retained under laws like the IT Act, 2000, Companies Act, 2013, GST Act, 2017, and financial reporting obligations.</p>

                            <h3>User Rights:</h3>
                            <p>You can request deletion of your personal data at any time (see Section 9). Deletion will occur within 30 days unless retention is required for legal or security reasons.</p>

                            <h3>Security of Stored Data:</h3>
                            <p>During retention, all personal data is encrypted and stored on secure servers (AWS India).</p>
                            <p>Access is limited to authorized Zavona personnel under strict confidentiality controls.</p>

                            <p>Zavona retains personal data only for as long as required to fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or as mandated by applicable Indian law. Typical retention periods vary depending on the type of data &mdash; for example, transactional and accounting records are kept as required under tax regulations, while profile, KYC, and support data are deleted or anonymized once the related purpose is complete. Specific timelines may change based on legal, security, or operational needs, and users can request deletion at any time as described in Section 9.</p>

This</p>
